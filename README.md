Build a client-side for an application called myFlix based on the existing server-side code REST API and database movie-api. <br>
A single page, responsive movie app built with Angular with routing and several interface views. <br>
Users will be able to user the app whenever they want to read information about different movies or update their user information.<br>

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.<br>

## Key Features
* App displays a welcome view where users are able to either log in or register an account.<br>
* Once authenticated, the user will now view all movies.<br>
* On the movie card, there are links to the movie genre, director, and movie synopsis, as well as one that adds the movie to their favorites. <br>
* When a user clicks on any of these links, a dialog opens that displays more details.<br>
* There is user profile component that allows users to view/edit their profile.<br>
* Angular's router is used to implement a route for the welcome view and user profile view.<br>
* Angular Material is used to create a responsive simple UI design.<br>

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
